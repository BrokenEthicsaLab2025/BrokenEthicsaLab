# BrokenEthicsaLab™

**Modular malware simulation suite for defender training, SOC validation, and reverse engineering.**

BrokenEthicsaLab™ is a scenario-driven, defender-first simulation toolkit that emulates evasive POS malware behaviors in a safe, controlled environment. Built for SOC teams, BAS vendors, and threat researchers, it enables validation of detection logic, telemetry analysis, and hands-on training against realistic attack chains.
